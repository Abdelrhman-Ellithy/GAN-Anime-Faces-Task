## Project Overview 📝
In this project, we explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their applications. The main objective is to implement and experiment with GANs to generate synthetic data. This notebook contains all the necessary code and explanations to understand and replicate the experiments.

## Installation 🛠️
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdelrhman-Ellithy/GAN-Anime-Faces-Task.git
    cd GAN-Anime-Faces-Task
    ```

## Usage 🚀
To run the notebook and start experimenting with GANs, follow these steps:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the `GAN-TASK-4.ipynb` notebook:**
    Navigate to the notebook file in the Jupyter interface and open it.

3. **Run the cells:**
    Execute the cells in the notebook to train the GAN and generate synthetic data.
